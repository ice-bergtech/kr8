# Roadmap

**kr8+** is mostly feature complete, and should be able to be used in production environments.

However, there are always things to improve:

* Build caching
* Refinement of the configuration management system
* Improve performance of rendering components
* Improve user input error handling and sharing
* Refine documentation for better understanding and usage, expecially around cluster `kr8_spec` and component `kr8_component_spec`
* Enable configuration of formatting
* Add additional linting to format command
* Add ability to fetch or coordinate fetching remote resources (e.g. Helm charts, CRDs etc.)
* Improve examples and tutorials for better onboarding
* Identify common tasks and integrate into **kr8+** or a jsonnet libsonnet library
* integrate `kr8-helpers` scripts into the main kr8 binary
* integrate `go-task` for preparing remote resource definition fetching scripts for user
* Register a domain for documentation
